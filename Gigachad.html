      <p>Gigachad appeared out of no where. He just appeared and asserted dominance over the beta males.
        Gigachad indulges in many activities that take up his time. Like sports, gaming, gardening, farming,
         space travel, dimension hopping, showing people how to become giga, cleaning up irresponsible people's
         messes, and helping all innocent people. Gigachad is the evoled version of the chad from 2010 rage comics.
         He has broken out of his cacoon and evolved from a chad to a Gigachad. He not only works on himself but
         also helps entire dimension's problems and turns them <b>GIGA</b>. Gigachad is truly a <b>CHAD</b>.
